# Demos

This repo holds all the jupyter notebook demos for the examples tab of Ivy's web. Relevant links:
- [List of open tasks avilable](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/issues/2) 
- [Open discussion to suggest new examples](https://github.com/unifyai/demos/issues/1)

All of the examples should be as comprehensible as possible, using easy-to-follow and attractive visuals (graphs, nicely formatted results, etc.), and follow the general tone of Ivy communications (feel free to include emojis and don't keep things super serious!).

Given that an internal release of the graph compiler is around the corner anybody should be able to start working on these examples shortly, so don't worry about not having access to the graph compiler / transpiler code for now, you can start to work on the notebook style/story!

If anyone has any question feel free to ping me (Guillermo) or use the Community/UX team discord channel!
